A Red Dragon’s Lair
Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in
caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep
halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds.
Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most
highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that
hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic
gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.
With its hoard well protected deep within the lair,
a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the
mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights
of the world are the throne from which it can look
out to survey all it controls—and the wider world it
seeks to control.
Throughout the lair complex, servants erect
monuments to the dragon’s power, telling the grim story
of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it
has conquered.
Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects;
the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
• Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon
can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high,
5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser’s
area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking
21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.
• A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around
the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on
the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
• Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius
sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within
120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners,
and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative
count 20 on the next round. Each creature that
starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end
of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is
incapacitated.
Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary red dragon’s lair is
warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or
more of the following effects:
• Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the
dragon’s lair.
• Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally
warm and tainted by sulfur.
• Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair form
portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures
of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.
If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course
of 1d10 days.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the dragon fails a saving
throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Actions
Multiattack. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
Frightful Presence. Each creature of the dragon’s choice that
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a
creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it,
the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for
the next 24 hours.
Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6). The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot
cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity
saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used
at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Detect. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
Tail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack.
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings.
Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed
on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8)
bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can
then fly up to half its flying speed.
The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon,
whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its
silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times,
and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry.

and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1
inch wide without squeezing.
Actions
Multiattack. The elemental makes two slam attacks.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Whirlwind (Recharge 4–6). Each creature in the elemental’s
space must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure,
a target takes 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage and is flung
up 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and
knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a
wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for
every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another
creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity
saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the
bludgeoning damage and isn’t flung away or knocked prone.
An air elemental is a funneling cloud of whirling air
with a vague semblance of a face. It can turn itself into
a screaming cyclone, creating a whirlwind that batters
creatures even as it flings them away.

Petrifying Gaze. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the
basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk
can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving
throw if the basilisk isn’t incapacitated. On a failed save, the
creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It
must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a
success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified
until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the
saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see
the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its
eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must
immediately make the save.
If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright
light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.
Actions
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
A basilisk is a multilegged, reptilian horror whose
deadly gaze transforms victims into porous stone. With

Berserk. Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points
or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of
its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature

smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues
to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.
The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem,
can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The
golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an

Ethereal Sight. The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal
Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
Incorporeal Movement. The ghost can move through other
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5
(1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
Actions
Withering Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.
Etherealness. The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the
Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane
while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can’t
affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
Horrifying Visage. Each non-undead creature within 60 feet
of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by
5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. A frightened
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.
If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it,
the target is immune to this ghost’s Horrifying Visage for the
next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater
restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.
Possession (Recharge 6). One humanoid that the ghost can see
within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving
throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears,
and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body.
The ghost now controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target
of awareness. The ghost can’t be targeted by any attack, spell,
or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its
alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to
being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed
target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s
knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points,
the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or
forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When
the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied
space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this
ghost’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving
throw or after the possession ends.
A ghost is the soul of a once-living creature, bound to
haunt a location, creature, or object from its life.

Petrifying Gaze. When a creature that can see the medusa’s
eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa
can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if
the medusa isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If
the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly
petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to
turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must
repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming
petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The
petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater
restoration spell or other magic.
Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the
saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it
can’t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can
avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the
meantime, it must immediately make the save.
If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface
within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is,
due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.
Actions
Multiattack. The medusa makes either three melee attacks—
one with its snake hair and two with its shortsword—or two
ranged attacks with its longbow.
Snake Hair. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one

Longbow. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 150/600
ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6)
poison damage.
A victim of a terrible curse, the serpent-haired medusa
petrifies all those who gaze upon it, turning creatures
into stone monuments to its corruption.

check against the nothic’s Wisdom (Insight) check. If the
nothic wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about
the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to

attaches to the target. While attached, the stirge doesn’t
attack. Instead, at the start of each of the stirge’s turns, the
target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points due to blood loss.
The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its
movement. It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood from
the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target,
can use its action to detach the stirge.
This horrid monster looks like a cross between a large

Eye Rays. The spectator shoots up to two of the following
magical eye rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90
feet of it. It can use each ray only once on a turn.
1. Confusion Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13
Wisdom saving throw, or it can’t take reactions until the end
of its next turn. On its turn, the target can’t move, and it uses
its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly
determined creature within range. If the target can’t attack, it
does nothing on its turn.
2. Paralyzing Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
3. Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with
disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the
effect on itself on a success.
4. Wounding Ray. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Create Food and Water. The spectator magically creates
enough food and water to sustain itself for 24 hours.
Reactions
Spell Reflection. If the spectator makes a successful saving
throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses it, the spectator
can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can
see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature
instead of the spectator. If the spell forced a saving throw, the
chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack,
the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.
A spectator is a lesser type of beholder—a foul and
deadly aberration. It resembles a floating sphere with
a gaping maw and a single great eye, set within four
eyestalks that shoot forth deadly rays.

Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a
target can’t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make
more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can
take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both.
These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
on a success.
Stone golems are magical constructs cut and chiseled

This section contains statistics for various humanoid
nonplayer characters (NPCs) that adventurers might
encounter during a D&D campaign. These stat
blocks can be used to represent both human and
nonhuman NPCs.
Customizing NPCs
There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in
this appendix for your home campaign.
Racial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC.
For example, a halfling priest might have a speed of 25
feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC
doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial
traits, see the Player’s Handbook or the D&D player’s
basic rules.
Spell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC
spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You
can substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a
different spell of the same level from the same spell list.
Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s
challenge rating.
Armor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or
downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons.
Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an
NPC’s challenge rating.
Magic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more
likely it has one or more magic items in its possession.
A mage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand,
as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an
NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its
challenge rating.
A few magic items are described in this document.

When creating a combat encounter, let your imagination
run wild and build something your players will enjoy.
Once you have the details figured out, use this section to
adjust the difficulty of the encounter.
Combat Encounter Difficulty
There are four categories of encounter difficulty.
Easy. An easy encounter doesn’t tax the characters’
resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose
a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed.
Medium. A medium encounter usually has one or
two scary moments for the players, but the characters
should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or
more of them might need to use healing resources.
Hard. A hard encounter could go badly for the
adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out
of the fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more
characters might die.
Deadly. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or
more player characters. Survival often requires good
tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.

Evaluating Encounter Difficulty
Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any
combat encounter.
1. Determine XP Thresholds. First, determine the
experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in
the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table
has four XP thresholds for each character level, one for
each category of encounter difficulty. Use a character’s
level to determine his or her XP thresholds. Repeat this
process for every character in the party.
2. Determine the Party’s XP Threshold. For each
category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters’
XP thresholds. This determines the party’s XP
threshold. You’ll end up with four totals, one for each
category of encounter difficulty.
For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level
characters and one 2nd-level character, the party’s
totaled XP thresholds would be as follows:
Easy: 275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50)
Medium: 550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + 100)
Hard: 825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150)
Deadly: 1,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200)
Record the totals, because you can use them for every
encounter in your adventure.
3. Total the Monsters’ XP. Add up the XP for all of
the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP
value in its stat block.
4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters. If the
encounter includes more than one monster, apply
a multiplier to the monsters’ total XP. The more
monsters there are, the more attack rolls you’re making
against the characters in a given round, and the more
dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge
an encounter’s difficulty, multiply the total XP of all
the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the
Encounter Multipliers table.
For example, if an encounter includes four monsters
worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP
of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP.
This adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth
in terms of XP; the adjusted value’s only purpose is to
help you accurately assess the encounter’s difficulty.
When making this calculation, don’t count any
monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below
the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the
group unless you think the weak monsters significantly
contribute to the difficulty of the encounter.
Encounter Multipliers
Number of
Monsters Multiplier
1 × 1
2 × 1.5
3–6 × 2
Number of
Monsters Multiplier
7–10 × 2.5
11–14 × 3
15 or more × 4
5. Compare XP. Compare the monsters’ adjusted
XP value to the party’s XP thresholds. The threshold
that equals the adjusted XP value determines the
encounter’s difficulty. If there’s no match, use the closest
threshold that is lower than the adjusted XP value.
For example, an encounter with one bugbear and
three hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000,
making it a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level
characters and one 2nd-level character (which has
a hard encounter threshold of 825 XP and a deadly
encounter threshold of 1,400 XP).

The Adventuring Day
Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average
luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six
to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the
adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers
can get through more. If it has more deadly encounters,
they can handle fewer.
In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an
encounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and
other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how
far the party is likely to progress.
For each character in the party, use the Adventuring
Day XP table to estimate how much XP that character is
expected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all
party members to get a total for the party’s adventuring
day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP
value for encounters the party can handle before the
characters will need to take a long rest.

Short Rests
In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the
party will likely need to take two short rests, about onethird
and two-thirds of the way through the day.
Modifying Encounter Difficulty
An encounter can be made easier or harder based on
the choice of location and the situation.
Increase the difficulty of the encounter by one step
(from easy to medium, for example) if the characters
have a drawback that their enemies don’t. Reduce the
difficulty by one step if the characters have a benefit that
their enemies don’t. Any additional benefit or drawback
pushes the encounter one step in the appropriate
direction. If the characters have both a benefit and a
drawback, the two cancel each other out.
Situational drawbacks include the following:
• The whole party is surprised, and the enemy isn’t.
• The enemy has cover, and the party doesn’t.
• The characters are unable to see the enemy.
• The characters are taking damage every round from
some environmental effect or magical source, and the
enemy isn’t.
• The characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst
of scaling a sheer wall or cliff, stuck to the floor, or otherwise
in a situation that greatly hinders their mobility
or makes them sitting ducks.
Party Size
The preceding guidelines assume that you have a party
consisting of three to five adventurers.
If the party contains fewer than three characters,
apply the next highest multiplier on the Encounter
Multipliers table. For example, apply a multiplier of
1.5 when the characters fight a single monster, and a
multiplier of 5 for groups of fifteen or more monsters.
If the party contains six or more characters, use the
next lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of
0.5 for a single monster.
Multipart Encounters
Sometimes an encounter features multiple enemies that
the party doesn’t face all at once. For example, monsters
might come at the party in waves. For such encounters,
treat each discrete part or wave as a separate encounter
for the purpose of determining its difficulty.
A party can’t benefit from a short rest between parts
of a multipart encounter, so they won’t be able to spend
Hit Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that
require a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted
XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is
higher than one-third of the party’s expected XP total
for the adventuring day (see “The Adventuring Day,”
below), the encounter is going to be tougher than the
sum of its parts.
Building Encounters on a Budget
You can build an encounter if you know its desired
difficulty. The party’s XP thresholds give you an XP
budget that you can spend on monsters to build easy,
medium, hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember
that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than
their base XP values would indicate (see step 4).
For example, using the party from step 2, you can
build a medium encounter by making sure that the
adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP
(the party’s threshold for a medium encounter) and
no more than 825 XP (the party’s threshold for a hard
encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such
as a manticore or owlbear) is worth 700 XP, so that’s
one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each
one will count for 1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of
dire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP
value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the
party as well.
To assist with this approach, appendix B in the
Dungeon Master’s Guide presents a list of all monsters
in the Monster Manual organized by challenge rating.
See also the appendix to this document for a list by CR
of the monsters included here.
Challenge Rating
When putting together an encounter or adventure, especially
at lower levels, exercise caution when using monsters whose
challenge rating is higher than the party’s average level. Such
a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to
take out adventurers of a lower level. For example, an ogre
has a challenge rating of 2, but it can kill a 1st-level wizard
with a single blow.

Situational benefits are similar to drawbacks except
that they benefit the characters instead of the enemy.
Fun Combat Encounters
The following features can add more fun and suspense
to a combat encounter:
• Terrain features that pose inherent risks to both the
characters and their enemies, such as a frayed rope
bridge and pools of green slime
• Terrain features that provide a change of elevation,
such as pits, stacks of empty crates, ledges,
and balconies
• Features that either inspire or force characters and
their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers,
kegs of gunpowder or oil, and whirling blade traps
• Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive positions,
so that characters who normally attack at range
are forced to move around the battlefield
• Different types of monsters working together
Magic Items
Every adventure holds the promise—but not a
guarantee—of finding one or more magic items. Lost
Mine of Phandelver contains an assortment of magic
items that hints at the wider variety of magic items
waiting to be found in the worlds of D&D. See the
Dungeon Master’s Guide for many more items.
Using a Magic Item
A magic item’s description explains how the item works.
Handling a magic item is enough to give a character
a sense that something is extraordinary about the
item. The identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an
item’s properties. Alternatively, a character can focus
on one magic item during a short rest, while being in
physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the
character learns the item’s properties, as well as how
to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is
enough to tell the taster what the potion does.
Some magic items require a creature to form a bond
with them before their magical properties can be used.
This bond is called attunement, and certain items
have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a
creature must be a member of that class to attune to the
item. If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature
qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or
features, not using a magic item or the like.
Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend
a short rest focused on only that item while being in
physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest
used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can take
the form of weapon practice, meditation, or some other
appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the
attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the
short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding
of how to activate any magical properties of the item,
including any necessary command words.
An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time,
and a creature can be attuned to no more than three
magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth
item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an
item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more
than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t
attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.
A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature
no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if
the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least
24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature
attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end
attunement by spending another short rest focused on
the item, unless the item is cursed.

gauntlets. They have no effect on you if your Strength is
19 or higher without them.
Gloves of Swimming and Climbing
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming
don’t cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus
to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.
Goggles of Night
Wondrous item, uncommon
While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision
out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision,
wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.
Headband of Intellect
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Your Intelligence score is 19 while you wear this
headband. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is
already 19 or higher.
Keoghtom’s Ointment
Wondrous item, uncommon
This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1
doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The
jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.
As an action, one dose of the ointment can be
swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that
receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be
poisoned, and is cured of any disease.
Potion of Flying
Potion, very rare
When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed
equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover.
If you’re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall
unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This
potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and
has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.
Potion of Invisibility
Potion, very rare
This potion’s container looks empty but feels as though
it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible
for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with
you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
Potion of Vitality
Potion, very rare
When you drink this potion, it removes any exhaustion
you are suffering and cures any disease or poison
affecting you. For the next 24 hours, you regain the
maximum number of hit points for any Hit Die you
spend. The potion’s crimson liquid regularly pulses with
dull light, calling to mind a heartbeat.
Item Descriptions
Amulet of Health
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this
amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is 19
or higher without it.
Armor, +1, +2, or +3
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2),
or legendary (+3)
You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The
bonus is determined by its rarity.
Bag of Holding
Wondrous item, uncommon
This bag has an interior space considerably larger
than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter
at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to
500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.
The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents.
Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures
and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the
Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents
spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right
before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside
the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal
to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1
minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.
Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional
space created by a Heward’s handy haversack, portable
hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it
to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then
closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.
Boots of Striding and Springing
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While you wear these boots, your walking speed
becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher,
and your speed isn’t reduced if you are encumbered
or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump
three times the normal distance, though you can’t jump
farther than your remaining movement would allow.
Cloak of Elvenkind
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom
(Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage,
and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks
made to hide, as the cloak’s color shifts to camouflage
you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just
as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is
copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on
an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10
+ the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is
successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or
fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.
Wand of Magic Detection
Wand, uncommon
This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can
expend 1 charge as an action to cast the detect magic
spell from it. The wand regains 1d3 expended charges
daily at dawn.
Wand of Magic Missiles
Wand, uncommon
While you hold this wand, you can use an action to
expend 1 to 3 of its 7 charges to cast the magic missile
spell without using any components. For 1 charge, you
cast the spell as if you used a 1st-level spell slot, and you
increase the spell slot level by one for each additional
charge you spend.
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day
at dawn. However, if you expend the wand’s last charge,
roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and
is destroyed.
Weapon, +1, +2, or +3
Weapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)
You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
this magic weapon. The bonus is determined by the
weapon’s rarity.
Ring of Evasion
Ring, rare (requires attunement)
This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended
charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving
throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction
to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving
throw instead.
Ring of Protection
Ring, rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while
wearing this ring.
Ring of Resistance
Ring, rare (requires attunement)
You have resistance to one damage type while wearing
this ring. The gem in the ring indicates the type, which
the DM chooses or determines randomly.

Spell Scroll
Scroll, varies
A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written
in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell
list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without
providing any material components. Otherwise, the
scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the
scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once
the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it
crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll
is not lost.
If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher
level than you can normally cast, you must make an
ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine
whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the
spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from
the scroll with no other effect.
Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade,
and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the
spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the
scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.
